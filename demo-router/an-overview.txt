Reference code to build a basic network (server -> router -> clients) using Python. 
Feel free to refer to this demo for code logic to build our network simulation :-)

Things to note:
1. This demo includes hardcoding of ARP table
    - Assumes complete understanding of IP-MAC mapping
    - No implementation of MAC/Ethernet broadcast since all mappings known

2. Project requirements
    - Broadcast frame to all devices within network, based on MAC address (Unicast API)
    - For every MAC, check for dest IP match, otherwise drop frame
